# Weather Dashboard 

This application displays the current date, retrieves the weather for the day in the city that the user enters in the search field, using latitude and longitude, and the five day forecast and displays them on the page.  The latitude and longitude and the weather data, which includes temperature, wind, humidity, and UV index were retrieved using API calls from the OneCall Weather API.  Once the user searches for a city, the cities searched are listed on the page and are saved using local storage, so that when the page is refreshed, the previous searches are still shown.
